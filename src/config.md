- `contextmenu_show_transform_selected_url_to_hyperlink`: if true and if you have selected a valid 
url you'll see an additional context menu entry
- `contextmenu_show_copy_url`(default "true"), `contextmenu_show_open_in_browser` (default "true"): 
option to show additional menues in the context menu
- `contextmenu_show_unlink`: if true the contextmenu has an entry to delete/unlink hyperlinks from 
the selection
- `contextmenu_show_set_link_text`: if true and if you have selected a valid url you'll see an 
additional context menu entry
- `encode_illegal_characters_in_links`: "Whether the character `"` will transformed in the
html source code to percent encoding
- `remove whitespace from beginning and end of urls`: Whether whitespace characters will be removed 
from the beginning and end of text you paste into the field 'Link to' in the dialog
- `shortcut_insert_link` "Ctrl+Shift+H",
- `shortcut_unlink`: "Ctrl+Shift+Alt+H",
- `unlink_button_and_shortcut`: if true there is an unlink button and a shortcut. I rarely use this 
function and if I do I use the contextmenu. That's why I prefer to set this to "false" to save 
some space.
